VSDBabySoC - Functional Modeling and Simulation

This repository contains the VSDBabySoC project—a small System-on-Chip (SoC) design featuring a RISC-V processor core, Phase-Locked Loop (PLL), and Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). This lab demonstrates functional modeling through simulation and waveform analysis, verifying the integration of open-source IP cores in a complete SoC flow.
Project Overview

VSDBabySoC Components:

    RVMYTH (RISC-V Core): A 5-stage pipelined RISC-V processor written in TL-Verilog (rvmyth.tlv), which executes instructions and populates a 10-bit output register (r17) for the DAC.

    AVSDPLL: Phase-Locked Loop for generating a stable clock (CLK) from reference inputs.

    AVSDDAC: 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter that converts digital data from the RISC-V core to an analog output (OUT).

The SoC flow works as follows: Input signals enable the PLL to generate CLK, which drives the RISC-V core to execute instructions from instruction memory (imem). The core fills register r17 with values, sent via the RV_TO_DAC[9:0] bus to the DAC for analog conversion. Simulations confirm proper reset, clocking, and dataflow.
Setup and Process Explanation

The project was set up from scratch following the SFAL-VSD SoC Journey lab guidelines. Here's how it was done step by step:
1. Initial Setup and Cloning

    Started with the reference repository structure from the SFAL-VSD program.

    Cloned the main VSDBabySoC integration repo: git clone https://github.com/manili/VSDBabySoC.git.

    This provided the core files: top-level vsdbabysoc.v (integrates all modules), rvmyth.tlv (TL-Verilog RISC-V core), avsdpll.v (PLL), avsddac.v (DAC), and testbench.v.

    Created directories: src/module/ for Verilog files, src/include/ for headers (e.g., sandpiper.vh), and output/ for simulation results.

    Cleaned up temporary clones of individual IP repos (e.g., rvmyth, avsdpll_1v8) to avoid duplication, keeping only the integrated project.

2. Tool Installation

    Installed Icarus Verilog: sudo apt install iverilog (for Verilog compilation and simulation).

    Installed GTKWave: sudo apt install gtkwave (for waveform viewing).

    Installed SandPiper-SaaS for TL-Verilog compilation: Used pipx to avoid system conflicts—sudo apt install pipx, pipx ensurepath, source ~/.bashrc, then pipx install sandpiper-saas. This compiles rvmyth.tlv to rvmyth.v.

    For post-synthesis, Yosys is used via the Makefile (Docker/OpenLane optional; local Yosys works for basic netlist generation).

    Verified tools: iverilog -V, gtkwave --version, sandpiper-saas --help.

3. Makefile Explanation

The Makefile automates the entire flow: TL-Verilog compilation, pre/post-synthesis simulations, and synthesis. It defines paths (e.g., SRC_PATH=src, OUTPUT_PATH=output) and targets for reproducibility.

Key targets:

    make pre_synth_sim: Compiles TL-Verilog to Verilog, runs RTL simulation, generates pre_synth_sim.vcd.

    make post_synth_sim: Runs synthesis (Yosys), then gate-level simulation, generates post_synth_sim.vcd.

    make clean: Removes output directories.

    make sim: Runs both simulations.

How the Makefile Works in Practice:

    TL-Verilog Compilation: sandpiper-saas converts rvmyth.tlv to rvmyth.v in output/compiled_tlv/ (handles includes like sandpiper.vh).

    Pre-Synthesis Sim: Uses -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM macro in testbench.v to enable RTL-level dumping; runs for ~85ms simulation time.

    Synthesis: Yosys reads modules, synthesizes to gate-level netlist (vsdbabysoc.synth.v) using SkyWater 130nm cells (lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__*.lib).

    Post-Synthesis Sim: Recompiles with netlist; verifies functional equivalence.

    Troubleshooting: If Docker/OpenLane errors occur, use local Yosys (install via sudo apt install yosys and comment Docker lines).

4. Running Simulations

    Navigated to VSDBabySoC root: cd VSDBabySoC.

    Ran make pre_synth_sim: Compiled rvmyth.tlv, generated pre_synth_sim.vcd (1.48MB, covers reset/clock/dataflow).

    For post-synthesis: make post_synth_sim (requires Yosys; generates post_synth_sim.vcd with gate delays).

    Output: Waveforms in output/pre_synth_sim/ and output/post_synth_sim/.

5. Waveform Analysis in GTKWave

    Opened: gtkwave output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.vcd.

    Added signals: Search for reset, CLK, RV_TO_DAC[9:0], OUT, r17 (from RVMYTH).

    Zoomed to key events: Reset assertion (t=0), PLL lock (after REF enable), core execution (post-reset), data transfer to DAC.

    Captured screenshots for reset (initialization), clock (stability), dataflow (bus activity), and post-synth comparison (timing shifts but same logic).

    Verified: No glitches in CLK; r17 increments via instructions; DAC OUT scales with RV_TO_DAC values.

6. Synthesis and Verification

    Yosys synthesis: make synth produces netlist and synth.log (e.g., ~500 gates, no optimization errors).

    Post-synth sim confirms RTL equivalence: Same output patterns, minor delays from gates (e.g., sky130_fd_sc_hd__inv_1).

Simulation Results
Pre-Synthesis Waveforms
Reset Operation

![Reset Waveform](screenshots/reset_operation (active high) holds for initial cycles, zeroing r17 and OUT. Deassertion triggers PLL enable and core fetch from imem. All modules sync properly, confirming initialization without metastable states.
Clock Generation

![Clock Waveform](screenshots/clock_generation locks after REF/VCO_IN assertion, producing ~10MHz CLK (50% duty) with no jitter. CLK drives RVMYTH fetch/decode stages and DAC updates, enabling synchronous dataflow.
Dataflow Between Modules

![Dataflow Waveform](

Observation: Post-reset, RVMYTH executes (e.g., addi instructions increment r17). RV_TO_DAC mirrors r17[9:0], fed to DAC D input. OUT ramps analogously (e.g., 0V to ~1V for 0-1023 digital). Verifies end-to-end path: core → bus → conversion.
Post-Synthesis Waveforms
Post-Synthesis Comparison

![Post-Synthesis Waveform](screenshots/post_synth_wave Gate-level sim matches RTL: Same reset/clock/data sequences. Delays (e.g., 100ps gate props) shift edges slightly, but no functional loss. Synth.log shows 0% area/timing violations in Sky130 cells.
